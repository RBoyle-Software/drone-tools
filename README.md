# PROP TIP SPEED CALC
Calculate tip speed and track values over time. Optimize settings to achieve maximum efficiency.


- [x] RPM * Prop Max Circumference over Distance / Time = Prop Tip Speed
- [x] Prop Tip Speed + Airspeed = Max Tip Speed?
- [x] Motor kV rating * battery V rating = unloaded RPM estimate
- [ ] consider airframe pitch, horizontal velocity, vertical velocity?
- [x] add input field for anticipated airspeed (convert knots to MPH?)
- [x] API call for temp, pressure, humidity / display local Mach 1
- [x] make it mobile browser-friendly
- [ ]
